She emphasizes below her journey to purpose after surviving:</p>
                                 <p> My story is similar to that of many widows who survived the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. I tell my story, not to emphasize the darkness of my past, but to thank God for the present and for the beautiful destiny he holds for me; the magnificent destiny he holds for other survivors of genocides and other atrocities. God’s plan is not to 
                                     harm us but to transform the darkness we experienced into a bright future. Believing in God’s love empowers me with confidence that strengthens my faith to trust in a promising future: a tomorrow that brings great surprises, a future that lifts and empowers, a future where peace prevails because I contributed to it. I invite all survivors 
                                     of atrocities to join me in a fight to break the cycle of generational poverty that was brought to us by civil unrest that culminated in the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. I also invite people around the globe to continue contributing to peace and to help us reach our destiny.</p>
                                     <p>During those 100 days in 1994, I lived the most traumatizing moments of my life. I walked between dead bodies. I heard children crying in latrines days and nights. I wore one top for three months. I had become a rock and could not think anymore; even after the genocide, only a walking corpse could live in Kigali. </p>
                                     <p> “I am on my 943rd kill,” I heard a man say while I was hiding so that I would not be the 944th. I think of that statement often and it calls me to promote education. If he had been taught to analyze the messages broadcasted on television and the radio—propaganda by the Hutu leadership that called Tutsi “cockroaches”—I 
                                         believe he would not have killed, nor declared his crimes with pride. </p>
                                         <p>Psalm 91:5-7 was the focus of my morning of April 27, 1994 when Interahamwe militias and military came to kill us in Butare;</p>
                                            <ol>
                                            5. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
                                            <br> 6. nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday. 
                                            <br> 7. A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.
                                        </ol>

                                        </p>
                                    <p>I survived in a huge forest, at a killing site where we were lined up waiting for our fate. Immobile, I saw machetes cut the bodies of Tutsis into pieces. I saw militias savagely kill my dear friends and who, to ensure they suffered enough, tortured them to death. No one was lucky enough to be killed with a bullet. On that morning, 
                                        I implored God to send a heavy rain so that I could leave the forest where dogs were barking and eating many bodies. It started to rain. </p>
                                        <p>Everyone I was with died around me. When I picture the children I was with, their parents, and how their lives were cut short within a matter of minutes, tears stream down my face. I feel so much pain, my heart beats faster, and I question why I survived—but quickly find an answer. If I survived, it was by God’s will. He rescued 
                                            me and called me to speak for those departed, to live with dignity, and to ensure no one else dies because of hatred.  </p>
                                    <p>Right after the genocide, I questioned the reason that I survived. Why me? What did I do to escape being killed? After all, I was brought in front of the killers six times. What is the purpose of surviving anyway? I kept asking myself these questions. I despaired without hope.  </p>
                                    <p>Later, I came to realize that God wanted me to survive; I survived for a reason. I survived not to give up, not to feel sorry for myself, but to gain strength, to wake up and bear my obligation of surviving. I survived to remember, to restore the dignity of my people, and to to ensure that peace prevails on our planet so that we can 
                                        all shout “Never Again” to genocide. Friends, if we want peace on our planet, if we want to build a peaceful society were our children can fulfill their destinies, we have an obligation to fight any form of hate and violence. We must do what it takes to prevent genocide from happening again. </p>
                                    <p>As a survivor of an unthinkable genocide—bearing the losses of my loved ones and with the support of my beautiful family—I strongly believe in the importance of, and the responsibility we have in, supporting survivors of atrocities. One of the basic steps toward peace is to lift survivors, to empower them, to morally and financially 
                                        assist them. Many of us have lost the lives of those we cherished and everything we called our own. We do not want bitterness to take over our hearts, nor do we want loneliness to govern our lives. We call for compassion and love. </p>
                                    <p> I have been dwelling on a project of this kind for more than ten years. I have spoken at many different places trying to be the voice of those we lost, but my heart kept telling me that I had not yet done what I am called to do—what I survived for. Last year, in January 2017, I found the remains of my daughters Clarisse Uwonkunda and 
                                        Raissa Umutoni, whom I lost during the genocide. When I traveled back to the United States, devoid of all strength, I felt so sick and was hospitalized. Even though I was relieved to bury my girls with dignity, I also felt emptiness inside. I asked myself, “have I done what I should? Have I done God’s purpose for me? What if I die without 
                                        accomplishing God’s will for which I survived?” Then, by the grace of God, my fear was washed out.  Today, I feel heathier and I believe it is the right time for me to answer God’s call—to start this organization and believe God’s is on our side. I am calling citizens of the world to lift up people whose lives were shaken, almost destroyed, 
                                        and lend them a hand with kindness and support. </p>
                                    <p>Ethnical identities pulled Rwandans apart and drew Rwanda into darkness. Hate speech propaganda on national television divided people, turning neighbors into enemies, instead of spreading love and unity. On this journey of surviving with dignity, I believe education is critical to prevent hatred and atrocities in our communities, our nations, 
                                        and our planet. I also believe that women are the “Center of Homes,” they bear the responsibility to care for precious lives and must be empowered to become more independent and self-reliant to bolster their contributions to peaceful communities. I hope you join Global Survivors for Peace in its commitment and determination to contribute to 
                                        a lasting peace on our planet. </p>
