                                <h5> The 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi</h5>

                                <p>To understand the atrocities of the 100 day the period that started April 7, 1994, we must understand some of the history of Rwanda. Genocide does not happen spontaneously, but is a consequence of complex social, 
                                  political, and economic realities as well as conscious efforts to dehumanize a group of people. The history of Rwanda is important to understanding the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi, and the history of genocide 
                                  is important to understand so that we never live it again.</p>

                                <h5>Hutu and Tutsi: The History</h5>

                                <p> The Hutu, a people who made up the majority of Rwanda, lived and worked together with the minority Tutsi for hundreds of years. Because these two groups spoke the same language, shared the same culture, and 
                                    frequently intermarried, it was very difficult to make a distinction among them by ethnic group. Before Rwanda was colonized, people were distinguished depending on the tribe they belonged to. Colonizers 
                                    brought the labels of Hutu and Tutsi for the Rwandan people, and which were designated based on their position in relation to the king, or Mwami, or how many cattle they owned. Put simply, in pre-colonial 
                                    Rwanda, Tutsi were seen as the cattle-herders and Hutu were the cultivators. Because of this structure, chiefs and other leaders, who typically owned many cattle, were mostly considered Tutsi and 
                                    agriculturists were mainly considered Hutu. </p>

                                <p>However, the arrival of colonizers at the start of the 20th century twisted the system to which Rwandans were accustomed. German colonizers used the Mwami-based political system to collect tax and lead 
                                    military campaigns against Hutu chiefs. After World War I, the League of Nations handed rule of Rwanda over to Belgium. The Belgian administration designated Rwandans either Tutsi or Hutu and forced 
                                    them to carry ethnic identity cards. Hutu extremists took advantage of these labels later on by enforcing ethnic-based restrictions to higher education and other rights. When colonial rule transitioned 
                                    to an end in the 1950s and 1960s, ethnic-based tensions rose and boiled over into conflicts, killing many Tutsis in several massacres. Tutsis living in Rwanda feared for their lives after retaliations
                                     between opposing groups of Hutus and external Tutsis culminated in the killing of thousands of Rwandan Tutsis. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes in Rwanda to seek asylum in other countries. </p>

                                <h5>The Beginnings of Violence</h5>

                                <p>In 1973, Juvénal Habyarimana, then minister of defense and police chief of staff, lead a coup of Hutu extremists to overthrow the first elected president of Rwanda. He installed a single-party government 
                                    with himself at the head. Despite pleas from the Tutsi diaspora, Habyarimana did not allow them to re-enter their homeland. Meanwhile, as violence continued inside Rwanda, Tutsis outside Rwanda formed the 
                                    Rwandan Patriotic Front, or RPF, in 1987 with the goal to liberate the country from Habyarimana’s rule. </p>

                                <p>In October 1990, the RPF launched a rebellion against Habyarimana’s government. As Immaculee G. Songa recalls, this was the first time many Tutsi inside Rwanda heard of the RPF’s existence. 
                                    She remembers that all Tutsis without exception were wrongly accused of being accomplices of the RPF, some were put in prison and tortured to death, and all denied access to education and employment. 
                                    The extremist Hutu became more obvious during the years following 1990 as the media became involved in spreading hatred and division. In December 1990, the Hutu Ten Commandments, a manifesto of 
                                    extremism calling on Hutus to reject Tutsis completely, was published in the anti-Tutsi propaganda newspaper Kangura. Hutu extremist militias, Interahamwe, began to form and arm themselves, 
                                    and Tutsis heard Hutus being called to “go to work,” a phrase which implied the coming genocide. </p>

                                <p>During the 1990s, Habyarimana met with representatives of the RPF for peace talks, and in 1994, angered Hutu extremists in his administration by continuing to seek an agreement with Tutsi leaders. 
                                    On April 6, 1994, Habyarimana and the president of Burundi were killed when their plane was shot down while returning to Rwanda from one of these negotiations for peace. Habyarimana’s death served 
                                    as the inciting incident that Hutu extremists needed to start the genocide of their Tutsi neighbors. The killing started that night. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h5>The Genocide</h5>

                                <p>Immaculee G. Songa recalls that people were told to stay in their homes, but many did not trust this advice and chose instead to flee to churches. Those who stayed in their homes were found there and killed. 
                                    Those who hid in churches for sanctuary were killed as well. Others were brought to public spaces to be killed in large numbers. Trucks transported dead bodies to mass graves. Bodies were found everywhere—in 
                                    mass graves, in homes, in forests, in latrines. Death was everywhere.</p>

                                <p>On April 7, Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu, and her ten Belgian UN peacekeeping guards were executed. Her death was part of a plan by Hutu extremists to silence the political influence of 
                                    Hutu moderate who could see the genocide of Tutsis and may declare to the world what was happening. The executions of the Belgian guards may have also discouraged foreign intervention in the violence. </p>

                                <h5>No Help</h5>

                                <p>Although almost 3,000 UN troops were on the ground in Rwanda the first week of the genocide, their mission became to evacuate foreign nationals and to defend only themselves. Journalist Mark Hubard reported 
                                    for the Guardian on April 12 that UN troops watched as Rwandans were killed and barred Tutsis from leaving on military aircraft. That same day Belgium announced that it would withdraw its troops from Rwanda. 
                                    Many other countries followed suit. Hundreds of thousands of people died before the UN conceded that the violence in Rwanda was genocide, and many more died before the international community agreed to 
                                    send 5,500 troops into the country in May.</p>

                                <p>When French troops arrived at the end of June, they did not stop the genocide, but created what they called a “safe area” in the south, which protected perpetrators of genocide who were fleeing the advance of the RPF. 
                                    Tutsis continued to be killed in the “safe area.” Interahamwe walked en mass toward neighboring countries unhindered by the foreign presence.</p>

                                <h5>The End of 100 Days</h5>

                                <p>On July 4, the RPF gained control of Rwanda’s capital city, Kigali, from the Hutu extremists, beginning the end of the genocide. In 100 days, more than one million people were killed by acts of genocide, according 
                                    to estimates by the Rwandan government. The horror of those days are not forgotten by survivors.  The 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi should be remembered by the global community who witnessed hatred and violence, 
                                    but stood idly by as genocide took more than one million precious lives.</p>

                                <h5>By Survivors for Survivors</h5>
